      Kermit the frog is famous for many things. These days, many of them are memes! There's the
      famous "none of my business meme" pictured here. There's dark kermit, scooter kermit, kermit

      The ice bucket challenge was a viral fundraiser for research into ALS, and sometimes other
      causes. Typically those involved would dump a bucket of ice over their head, and then nominate
      another person to do the same and donate to the cause. Since it's winter in the Pacific
      Northwest, and hypothermia is a thing, I have altered the challenge. My 'costume' is a bit of
      a two-fer- in the early 2000's, what can best be attributed to a a successful guerilla
      marketing campaign by Smirnoff, dumb kids such as myself would "ice" one another by hiding a
      Smirnoff ice and chanting "Ice!" Until the beverage was consumed. I have also chosen to
      incorporate a fundraiser with my costume, so for every ultimate player who completes my
      challenge this weekend, I'll be donating $2 to Causa, an Oregon immigrant's rights
      organization.
